# REEFMOD.6.8_GBR

This repository contains the scripts of ReefMod-GBR, a coral individual-based model that simulates coral populations across 2,300 km of Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). This version was used (Feb-Apr 2022) to forecast possible futures of the GBR under climate change scenarios (CMIP-5) and assess the possible benefits of reef restoration techniques for the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP: https://gbrrestoration.org/).

The model reconstructs coral trajectories across the GBR between 2008-2022 and forecasts possible coral futures (2022-2100) based on temporally- and spatially-explicit forcing of water quality, cyclones, heat stress (coral bleaching) and the simulated population dynamics of the coral-eating (crown-of-thorns) starfish. Options for simulating management interventions on any given reef include:
- the outplanting of corals of specified species group, size and heat tolerance at a specified density
- the enrichment of coral larvae of specified species group with a specified density
- the reduction of heat stress through Solar Radiation Management (fogging)
- the consolidation of lose coral rubble to increase survival of coral recruits

This version also simulates the CoTS control program in space and time from 2019 onwards, with a specific number of boats (default: 5 boats) and the list of priority reefs as currently (2021) defined by GBRMPA.
